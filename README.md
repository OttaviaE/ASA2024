# Contributed session: Developing, administering and refining measurement instruments in Social Sciences
Proponents: Ottavia M. Epifania, Pasquale Anselmi
Chair: Livio Finos

The need for valid and reliable measurement instruments in Social Sciences is well established, also for the sake of the replicability of the results. This contributed session presents three contributions where the development, administration, and refinement of measurement instruments in Social Sciences are tackled under different perspectives. Specifically, the first contribution is about the development and validation of a new measurement tool for assessing soft skills using Knowledge Space Theory (KST). The second contribution describes the advantages provided by KST for the efficient administration of a test in a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) instance. Finally, the last contribution focuses on a different perspective, namely Item Response Theory, and presents a new algorithm for the intelligent selection of items from an item bank for the development of short questionnaires with specific characteristics defined by test developers. A final discussion on the usefulness of these and related approaches for the social sciences conclude the contributed session. 

The session will be held on September 19, 2024 in Room 1 (Gini) at 4:00pm. The full conference program is available [here](https://cess2022.dss.uniroma1.it/event/10/attachments/118/413/PROGRAMME%20ASA2024%20CONFERENCE%20ver%202%2009rev.pdf)
